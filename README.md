# Ideas and plans.
1. Initially, create a structure and the ability to add and store products indicating their calorie content, proteins, fats and carbohydrates per 100 g of product.
2. Add the ability to record and store statistics.
3. Add additional options for displaying statistics.


# The code will look terrible at first, but it's better than nothing. Plus, I'm just starting to learn Rust, so as the project evolves, the code will transform and become better and better. :3
